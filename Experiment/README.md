## Experiment

The project combines OpenMl and Rapidminer in creating a process with different parameters for its operators. The process includes a SVM operator for classification, but it can be changed according to the purpose. 

## Installation
What is needed:
- A config file for OpenMl, at least with your credentials.
- RapidMiner Studio.

Change the following line in the **build.gradle** file so that it points out at the RapidMiner installation directory:

 - `compile fileTree(dir: 'C:\\Program Files\\RapidMiner\\RapidMiner Studio\\lib\\', include: ['*.jar'])`
